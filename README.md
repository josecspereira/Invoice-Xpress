# InvoiceExpress-Wrapper
WIP This readme is under construction

Demo Features enabled:
- Building object with apikey and account name (required);
- List all invoices (without query for now, so only 10 invoice receipts will list) WIP;
- Get and Create client;
- List all sequences or a specific one

TODO
- Add missig useful methods, like edit customer
- Add option system to make syntax clearer
- Add cachinc for sequences and customers so we can save some api calls (that seem to take longer than they should)
